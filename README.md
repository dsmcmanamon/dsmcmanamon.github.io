# Nan Shepherd

Nan Shepherd (1893&ndash;1981) was a Scottish writer and university lecturer.  
Shepherd's last published work, *The Living Mountain &mdash; A celebration of
the Cairngorm Mountains of Scotland* (1977), has gained in popularity during
recent years. The three novels she published during the 1920s and 1930s remain
less well known. 

Very little academic work on Shepherd's novels can be found online.  If you are
persistent you might find a chapter on her, within a more general study of
Scottish female writers. But little has been done which looks at her work
as a whole.

## Finding Shepherd's work

Shepherd's novels (*The Quarry Wood*, *The Weatherhouse*, *A Pass in the
Grampians*) remain out of print. *The Grampian Quartet* was published in 1996
by Canongate Classics and contains the three novels along with *The Living
Mountain* and is the easiest way to get hold of her complete prose works.

She also published *In the Cairngorms*, a collection of her poetry. This has
been recently reissued (2014) by Galileo Publishers, Cambridge.
